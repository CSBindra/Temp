IntroducIng esg
What is esg? 
ESG – the acronym for Environmental, Social and Governance – is a generic term for 
evaluating corporate behaviour and nowadays used interchangeably with sustainable, 
responsible, impact or ethical investment. It may be viewed as a successor to Socially 
Responsible Investment (SRI), which is gaining popularity worldwide. But unlike SRI, which 
relies on negative screening, ESG propounds an underlying philosophy of larger good 
without overlooking financial or economic viability. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) – 
an India economy/regulatory phenomenon that is often mistaken for ESG – is actually only 
a small part of ESG.

What is esg investing?
Traditional investment parameters talk up corporate ratios and financial returns, which 
are quantitative and numeric. Valuation methodologies may be fairly subjective, but 
they too are ultimately quantitative measures. Investing based on an ESG framework, 
is a desirable add-on that quantifies the qualitative impact of business, namely its 
Environmental, Social and Governance aspects. ESG investing is thus a comprehensive 
approach that integrates the Environmental, Social and Governance factors into 
investment analysis and decision-making. 
Consequently, from investors’ standpoint, ESG data are increasingly important to 
identify companies that do business the right way and are well positioned to exploit 
the opportunities thereof. And for policymakers too, it should be a welcome market-led

development that ascribes a high weighting to common good (or avoiding common bad), 
which is typically sacrificed at the altar of short-term profit making.
Why is esg investing important?
ESG norms are progressively defining the way businesses should operate, particularly in 
developed markets. environmental sensitivity continues to rise as health, lifestyle and 
economic risks are increasingly quantified. social imbalances are becoming political hot 
potatoes: whether it’s rising economic disparities and opportunities, gender biases or 
social class systems. And governance makes headlines – until recently more often the lack 
of it – with progressively lower odds of sparing those that let down or get caught. 
Over time, ESG has risen from being a fuzzy concept to a business, investing and political 
priority – whether global or Indian – and it shall, eventually, command overriding importance 
in the world of business as well as investments. We see ESG increasingly driving: a) the 
quality of companies and the way they conduct business; b) higher economic returns that 
such businesses generate over the long term – in spite of short-term or upfront financial 
costs or trade-offs; c) investor orientation and investment mandates, and the flow of 
capital; d) higher financial returns – for businesses and investors; e) regulatory tightening 
or operating risks for businesses, particularly that are not compliant; and f ) goodwill for 
businesses within the sociopolitical space they operate in. It’s a wide ambit.  
In general, ESG norms are tightening and, therefore, profit preservation would 
nudge companies to meet the statutory ESG requirements. In this constantly evolving 
operating landscape, only companies that have built businesses on ESG foundations shall 
eventually thrive.

InvestIng In esg
ESG investing is big. Assets mandated globally under SRI strategies jumped from 
USD 11 trillion in 2012 to USD 23 trillion in 2016. Tracking the trend, SRI assets in India 
more than doubled to about USD 30 billion from USD 13 billion over the period. Globally, 
SRI accounts for about one-fifth of capital under management*. While there could 
be definitional variances (ESG, SRI, Sustainable Investing among others), broadly 
defined ESG investing is already very large and among the fastest-growing investment 
segments globally.
a. esg investments in spotlight
  Over the past decade, sustainability has emerged as a crucial aspect of investing. 
This is evident from the exponential rise in publicly available information as well as 
signatories to the United Nations' Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI). The rising 
number of ESG equity indices across major stock exchanges is only reflective of this 
expansion. In fact, leading European investment firm Schroders states that it is now 
standard for institutional asset owners to ask about asset managers’ credentials in 
integrating ESG considerations in the investment process. The firm further states that 
retail investors have also shown appetite for products that recognise and reflect the 
relationship between their investments and an increasingly challenging social and 
environmental backdrop.

 surge in esg investments
  ESG assets and funds have accelerated since 2015 in the wake of growing demand 
for such strategies. According to a Bloomberg Intelligence study, ESG asset growth 
accelerated to 37% in 2017, outpacing the 23% uptick in assets under the MSCI World 
Index. Similarly, the number of funds created in 2017 were twice that of 2014. While 
ESG investing is relatively niche today, it is progressively getting mainstream.

 Where esg assets reside — europe leads
  ESG investing is very large, and the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance (GSIA) 
suggests assets worth USD 23 trillion were managed under ‘responsible investment 
strategies’ globally in 2016—a spike of 25% vis-à-vis 2014. India's share in this is a 
miniscule 0.1%. But where have these assets originated globally, and what are its 
geographic and growth trends? Europe is the pioneer of ESG consciousness and 
investing, and the dominant driver of perky growth in ESG investing. Even today, 
more than 50% of its investments are ESG-sensitive or benchmarked, and well ahead 
of comparable geographies. 
  That said, ESG investing is catching on in other major geographies of the world 
with the share of ESG-sensitive funds taking off over the last few years. Australia/
New Zealand have about 50% of assets under the ESG umbrella and Canada over 
a third. The US has been a relative underperformer so far with less than a quarter of 
ESG-tagged assets. It is, however, catching up and could well make the most rapid 
strides in such investing in the years ahead.

Asia lags
 Asia makes up the tail with only a miniscule share of ESG assets. This probably reflects the 
nascent state of its capital markets and relatively hard focus on growth and opportunities 
in respective economies. Or it may have been broader ESG challenges in Asian markets, 
which diminish the attractiveness of such investment. It should, however, also suggest a 
tipping point in ESG investing may not be far away in Asia as the market awakens to such 
shifts and changing investor needs.

esg investing in India: nascent; global investors dominate
 It’s still early days for ESG investing in India. There is one large, and only somewhat 
prominent, domestic ESG fund. We believe there is another on the anvil, but that is likely 
to be more focussed on global pools of capital. This would change in our view, albeit the 
start and getting the momentum going is typically the most challenging phase, and this is 
where domestic ESG assets are currently positioned.
 Nevertheless, ESG funds have not shied away from investing in India. According to the 
GSIA, as many as 41 Global E&S seeking funds (aggregating USD 15 billion) have invested 
on an average 25% of their funds in Indian equities. 95 global socially responsible funds 
have invested in India and allocated on an average 18.5% to Indian companies (their 
total fund corpus is USD 25 billion). This is sizeable, and reflects the hectic activity among 
these funds. And that assets mandated under the ESG umbrella are likely to spike in India 
seems to be a foregone conclusion.

  India’s share in global investing is a relatively modest proportion—a 7–8% benchmark 
for emerging markets and about 1% for global pools. India’s share of investments in 
global ESG funds is, however, higher, and accounts for 19% of such funds. It would 
aggregate about USD 25 billion in ESG-benchmarked equity investments. This is a 
little under 7% of the total foreign institutional equity investment in India. We contend 
this is not insignificant, and suggests ESG-benchmarked investing is gaining ground 
in India, but not appreciated adequately by businesses and the investing community 
at large. While we expect global investors to continue to get more ESG-sensitive, it is 
possibly the domestic Indian investor that could see the more sizeable shifts towards 
such an investment approach, not to mention expansion in ESG-themed asset-raising.

 sufficient evidence of superior returns at lower risk 
  Several empirical studies indicate that investors and markets reward companies that 
score highly on ESG parameters. For instance, MSCI ESG Indices for India and overseas 
have consistently outperformed their respective broader benchmarks delivering 
superior risk-adjusted returns. Similarly, we note that ESG-focused companies not 
only command valuation premiums, but portfolios comprising strong ESG companies 
have sustainably outperformed non-ESG portfolios, generating greater risk-adjusted 
returns and showing lower drawdown risks. In fact, most well-known global MSCI ESG 
indices have outperformed their respective broader country indices over periods of 
three–five-years.

 How long have ESG investments been in place? A glance at the launch timeline of ESG 
indices globally clearly suggests that the US and Europe have been at the forefront. For 
instance, ESG indices in the US were launched in early 1990s—MSCI KLD 400 Social Index 
in 1990 and several thereafter over the next 15 years. In India, ESG indices debuted only 
recently in 2012. Five additional indices have been launched since, which suggests the 
groundwork and the institutional framework for more rapid growth for this asset class is 
in place.

  We observe interesting trends in the evolution of global ESG indices. The initial ones 
were broad-based with focus on ‘Environmental’ issues. Unsurprisingly the ‘negative 
screening or exclusionary’ ESG strategy was more popular then. The recent ESG index 
launches in the US and Europe are based on specific social or governance themes or 
impact investing. Thematic ESG indices show that the two geographies are ahead 
of the curve, also indicating an investment shift away from broad-based indices. 
India, currently in the nascent phase of ESG investing, understandably shows a skew 
towards broad-based ESG indices.

A snapshot of ESG indices: Broad-based versus specific theme/impact-based 
c. esg investment strategies – traditional exclusionary dominates
  Investors typically classify ESG-based strategies into seven pockets, out of which 
negative screening/exclusion currently dominates. Negative screening involves 
exclusion of certain sectors or companies or practices based on specific ESG 
criteria prohibiting investments in businesses such as tobacco, liquor, mining and 
defence. That said, we spot a gradual but discernible shift from negative screening 
to progressive preference for positive and actively managed ESG funds. The launch 
of varied theme-based ESG indices and benchmarks shows that ESG investing 
is becoming nuanced and sophisticated.

ESG index constituents: Many in broad-based, fewer in theme-based
styles of sustainable investment
The GSIA defines sustainable investing as an approach that relies on ESG screening 
in portfolio selection. This is now accepted as the global standard of classification in 
sustainable investing and is classified into:
1.  negative/exclusionary screening: It involves steering clear of sectors, companies 
or practices based on certain ESG criteria, e.g. refraining from investments in 
tobacco and liquor companies. 
2.  Positive/best-in-class screening: It advocates investments in sectors, companies 
or projects with positive ESG performance, e.g. ones with track records of enhancing 
stakeholder value via periodic ESG disclosures.
3.  norms-based screening: Screens investments based on minimal standards of 
business practices, much like negative screening, but strikes out ones that do not 
comply with norms such as the Koyoto Protocol.
4.  esg integration: Systematic and explicit inclusion of environmental, social and 
governance factors into financial analysis by investment managers. 
5.  sustainability themed investing: Investment in specific themes or assets 
related to sustainability such as clean energy, green technology and sustainable 
agriculture.
6.  Impact/community investing: Aimed at solving social or environmental 
problems by directing capital towards underserved individuals or communities, 
and is typically seen in private markets.
7.  corporate engagement and shareholder action: This approach favours 
companies whose strategies are susceptible to investor activism via direct 
corporate engagement, proxy voting based on ESG guidelines, etc.

esg’s place on investment horizon 
 While ESG has been variously defined, described and tagged, where exactly is it positioned 
in the world of investing, and how does it compare with other more traditional forms of 
investing? We argue ESG investing is not straight-jacketed, and it is a continuum. And we 
do believe its definition will continue to evolve. 
 We also believe it will be differently defined, and positioned, by the investing community. 
This will effectively mean that ESG investing will be categorised into a mix of investment 
purpose, economic returns, social good and influence, i.e. the balance between financial 
and non-financial asks. These definitions and measures will also be graded, rather than 
being binary. In effect, ESG will continue to be widely defined, leaving it subject to 
interpretation and vast in scope. It will also differ based on the perspective it’s looked from: 
the business, investor or regulator. 
Halfway house
 One way of plotting ESG on the investment spectrum is to place it between a purely 
financial returns-based approach and a decidedly philanthropic perspective. The scope 
for ESG investing falls in between these poles: balancing returns and impact, with some 
convergence, whichever end you might approach it from. This approach also suggests that 
ESG investing typically moves from a predominantly profit-only motive towards one that is 
initially more responsible and more sustainable. This is where investing the ESG Way finally 
settles and creates value. The investing spectrum eventually moves to impact and then 
philanthropic investing, where financial returns fall beyond the purview of ESG investing.

Another perspective on ESG investing is the trade-offs and its stages. This suggests that the 
first move to ESG investing entails certain costs and trade-offs. But as one progresses along 
the spectrum to intermediate stages, there are in effect no real costs. Further headway 
down the ESG Way of doing business eventually enhances financial returns. This investment 
approach focuses on a tightly-defined ESG scale.

Our approach to the ESG Way, by definition, allows that it is more comprehensive than 
some of these approaches suggest. This will allow investors and businesses to approach 
ESG in a more broad-based way, and effectively widen the business, and some of their 
components, that will allows investors to convincingly treat them as ESG opportunities, 
and will be more inclusionary than exclusionary.

esg evolutIon 
As a concept, ESG investing dates back to January 2004, when former UN Secretary General 
Kofi Annan wrote to over 50 CEOs of major global financial institutions, inviting them to 
participate in a joint initiative under the auspices of the UN Global Compact. The primary 
goal was to find ways of integrating ESG philosophies into capital markets. A year later, the 
term “ESG” was coined in a landmark study titled Who Cares Wins. Since then, ESG investing 
has come a long way, currently accounting for almost a quarter of all professionally 
managed assets (USD 23 trillion) in the world. 
Beyond srI
To reiterate, ESG is a successor to SRI, but unlike SRI, which uses negative screens, ESG 
investing has underpinnings of financial viability. The Who Cares Wins report by Ivo 
Knoepfel and the Freshfields report by UNEP/FI emphasise the financial importance of 
embedding environmental, social and governance factors in capital markets. These two 
reports were precursors to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) at the New York 
Stock Exchange in 2006 and the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (SSEI) in 2007.
In early days, ESG did face headwinds as institutional investors largely believed 
maximisation of shareholder wealth – regardless of their environmental or social 
impacts, or broader governance issues – as their sole fiduciary duty. Another major 
barrier to Seeking Growth – The ESG Way has been sketchy data and lack of necessary 
tools to size up ESG avenues or prospects. Over time, empirical studies have crystallised 
the rewarding “ESG Way”, which has engendered willingness among stakeholders across 
businesses and the investment fraternity to integrate ESG in decision-making. 
united nations shows the way: 17 sustainable developmental goals 
ESG has gained currency in the past decade, particularly with the United Nations 
Organisation (UNO) formulating a list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
In 2015, leaders from 193 countries deliberated and adopted the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development. The SDGs are exhaustive and adopted by the UN as the 
basis for sustainable development—and are increasingly being used by governments, 
businesses and investors too as benchmarks for their sustainability initiatives. 
The SDGs, also known as the Global Goals, are also a universal call to action to end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure peace and prosperity for all. They are built on the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), include pressing topics such as climate change, economic 
inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, peace and justice, among others. While 
these MDGs typically apply to countries and societies across the board, they are likely to 
be more specifically used by businesses and investors. They do also have a more social and 
environmental bias, with governance being more of an offshoot.

But are these SDGs only a response to more challenging times for the world at large, and 
only a defensive response to things getting tougher, for people at large? That’s debatable. 
There is a growing view that the world has, across a range of parameters, actually changed 
pretty fast and sustainably over the last few decades. The idea is forcefully argued by 
Hans Rosling in his provocative book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong About the 
World – and Why Things are Better Than You Think. The author points out that, the extent 
and pace of improvement across most social and gender parameters is unprecedented. 
We therefore contend that SDGs are really an effort to raise the quality of life across the 
planet, limit the risks to environment, and support a more equitable socioeconomic system.

India’s sustainability goals
India is in sync with the UNO's SDGs. The country’s top planning body NITI Aayog has fine-
tuned the 17 SDGs to Indian realities and inked a Sustainable Development Framework 
(SDF) for 2018–22 with the UNO. It is entrusted with implementing ‘Transforming our 
world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Framework’ (called SDF). The SDF 
covers 17 goals and 169 related targets thrashed out at the UN Sustainable Development 
Summit over 25–27 September 2015 over the 15-year period. More than anything else, the 
SDF is a reflection of India’s commitment to attaining SDGs. 
sizeable budget to promote sustainability goals
The Government of India has earmarked a sizeable budget of INR 110 trillion for the 
programme. The focus areas: post are poverty and urbanisation; health, water, and 
sanitation; education; nutrition and food security; climate change, clean energy and 
disaster resilience; skilling, entrepreneurship and job creation; and gender equality and 
youth development. The task at hand for NITI Aayog is not merely to collate data on SDG, 
but to act proactively to fructify the goals and targets quantitatively while maintaining 
high ESG standards. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has 
already undertaken a parallel exercise—it interacted with various ministries to formulate 
measurable indicators for SDF. 
All such initiatives show the government’s clear intent to abide by the framework given its 
huge likely influence on aspects such as Environment (all the more relevant given India’s 
mammoth population), Social (disparities due to economics, history, culture, diversity, 
etc), and Governance (need for strong  institutions and frameworks). While some of 
these commitments will be politically and economically challenging to execute, its need 
is probably more paramount than for most, given problems and complexities of a large 
nation with more than a billion inhabitants.

esg – tHe IndIA eXPerIence
So how does India stack up against ESG benchmarks? Our bottom-up analysis of India’s 
NIFTY 50 companies shows that ESG initiatives as well as disclosures have shot up, but still 
lag global standards. The tightening reporting standards uncover serious ESG shortfalls 
at several leading corporates—a grim reminder that major ESG disasters in the recent 
past are not freak or one-off accidents, but gaps in business models, and that more 
accidents are waiting to happen. We see these gaps, at the country level, narrowing. The 
ESG gaps and standards vis-a-vis developed markets are also narrowing, but remain too 
large for comfort and calls for accelerating India’s ESG quotient if it is to close out these 
gaps in the medium term. 
1) A Bottom-up Aggregation: India’s rising esg scores
 a)  esg disclosures steadily rising. The Social disclosure levels more than 
doubled from 2010 through 2017; in fact, India dramatically outscores USA on 
Social disclosures. The country’s Environmental score too has improved over 
the years and is set to improve further amid rising awareness. While regulatory 
push and the government’s pull (read ‘incentives’) are marshalling companies 
into compliance with ESG standards, corporate India’s newfound willingness to 
adopt cleaner business processes too is an encouraging dynamic pushing up 
compliance.

 b)  India lags global standards. In spite of hectic activity in corporate boardrooms 
for an urgent need to develop businesses sustainably, India by far lags on 
the Environment and Governance parameters. And being a signatory to the 
Paris Treaty and the COP21 Conference, India must abide by the stringent 
environmental targets it has set for itself. This may look overly optimistic 
currently, but we contend India is catching up fast and should close out the 
gaps in Environment score vis-à-vis global peers—including Europe, which 
fares the best on ESG. On the country’s Governance quotient, we believe many 
subtle but far-reaching revisions to the Companies Act and stricter board norms 
have raised the bar and that eventually corporate India’s track record should not 
fall far behind.

  notoriously high pollution ails India…
   Environment is palpably India’s weakest link – in standards, impact and the 
seriousness with which it is taken at the government, business and monitoring 
levels. A case in point is the alarming air pollution in the country—vehicle 
emissions alone account for about one-fourth. According to the World Trade 
Organisation, capital New Delhi ranks a notorious 6th among the most polluted 
cities of the world with an annual mean PM2.5 reading of 143ug/m3. The WTO 
pegs this health hazard equivalent to smoking about ten cigarettes a day.

  We therefore, believe Environment is also where regulation will shift the most and 
implementation cost on business will be the highest (but benefits will be most 
quantifiable). That some of these challenges are not necessarily driven by scale and 
organised business (i.e. small businesses, agricultural practices) makes it politically 
tougher to tackle them, more so through legislation, and will raise the risk for and 
need of large businesses to overcompensate.  
  …but heave a sigh of relief
  The Indian government has taken note and is expediting the rollout of city gas 
distribution (CGD) to new geographies—one of its several initiatives to remedy the 
worsening pollution levels. To be precise, the number of geographies for CGD licensing 
has doubled over four years through 2018. In 2015, the government announced the 
country would leapfrog from Bharat Stage IV emission norms for vehicles to Bharat 
Stage VI by 2020—a laudable move in our opinion. Such initiatives would notably 
curtail pollution levels in a few years.

Stepping on the gas: Licenses for new CGD geographies being rolled out rapidly
 greenhouse gas emissions in India trending down
  Government regulations and awakening towards sustainable development among 
bellwethers of corporate India have clamped down GHG and CO2 gas emissions 
of Indian companies over the past decade. The regulatory push towards curbing 
emissions is being powered by Bharat Stage VI emission standards, the National 
Air Quality Index, and introduction of FAME II Scheme for EV, which together pave 
a pathway for India’s future devoid of harmful greenhouse gases. That emission 
improvements are now visible on a sustainable basis, reflect tightening policy and 
implementation, and a corporate shift towards the same.

  the csr push in India
   India promulgated a landmark CSR law in 2014. It changed the landscape and 
approach to social support that businesses provide. The law stipulates that 
companies of a particular scale and profitability must spend 2% of average 
profits for preceding three years towards a wider defined set of social activities 
and objectives. The law further specifies that CSR initiatives must be run under 
the direct supervision of a board committee. 
   While the law seeks to sustainably funnel a sizeable corpus towards social 
funding, it has – importantly and most likely inadvertently – made such 
spends centre stage for corporate CEOs and brought in significant attention 
and focus to the task. Programmes pertaining to women empowerment, girl 
child, education, etc have thus spawned across corporate India and are run 
either independently or under the guidance of reputed non-governmental 
organisations. We understand funding for CSR initiatives is significant and 
should fundamentally grow ahead of India corporate sector profitability as 
businesses increasingly toe the statutory line and growing companies fall into 
the ambit of CSR framework.       
   The actual CSR spend moved up progressively to almost INR 90 billion in 2018 
and is rising. In addition, businesses are increasingly meeting their minimum 
requirements, up from 75% to 92% over the last three years. While there is still 
a gap, it’s only moderate 8%, and is typically on account of glitches and 
execution issues rather than intent. The corporate sector always did have social 
initiatives and commitments, but CSR has boosted and widened these spends, 
and in many ways coalesced and quantified them.

   Actually, the social efforts of businesses go much beyond spend; such capital 
commitments also reflect a social bias. Interestingly, as much as 60% of India’s 
CSR spends go toward education and skill development. This not only zooms 
in on one of the glaring gaps in the India socioeconomic framework, but the 
needs that are most prominently felt by business. In addition, this indicates an 
investment in society bias, rather than band-aid spending, which continues 
to be seen as more the domain of the government. There is, however, a wide 
range of spends and we would argue the opportunities and spaces will only 
tend to widen. In fact the large availability of funding over the recent years has 
in pockets actually created a POP – problem of plenty – marked by a lack of 
enough development ground-level entities (e.g. NGOs), which can effectively 
channel this money appropriately.

  government leads…
   While the government is responsible and leads social spends, a few initiatives go 
hand-in-hand with the private sector. One such initiative has yielded enormous 
health and environmental benefits, and is reflective of the opportunity that 
the Indian economy offers.  This one called the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana 
(PMUY) seeks to eliminate harmful cooking fuels such as firewood and coal, 
which are big sources of carbon emissions in India and put women and children 
at great risk. The Yojana or scheme encourages well-to-do households to give 
up LPG subsidies while extending subsidised connections to those dependent 
on unconventional cooking fuels.

   Oil marketing companies, in particular, have been at the forefront of executing 
this scheme, not just because it is government mandated, but for the improved 
economics (and better financial health) it promises. The scheme leverages 
digital payments established by Aadhaar identification and is one of the 
prime examples of financial inclusion. It has nearly doubled LPG connections 
in the country to 240 million households, saves the government a neat 
USD 6.3 billion every year, and is at the forefront of environmental, health and

  India’s mixed record
   Daunting corporate governance challenges – with some prominent ones 
recently – are a clarion call for stringent governance norms, including board 
independence, stronger audit committees and stricter disclosure norms. For 
example, the proportion of independent directors in India vis-à-vis Europe 
and the US is dismally low. That said, we expect this aberration to continue 
to correct given Indian companies’ newfound realisation about corporate 
governance, which is driving greater transparency and overall better 
governance.

27% in India vis-à-vis countries such as Cambodia that have a female LFPR as 
high as 81%. Even smaller neighbouring economies Bangladesh and Sri Lanka 
outclass India on female LFPR. All of this indicates the need to awaken societal 
consciousness, particularly in remote areas where female participation in labour 
force is discouraged to avoid social stigma.

Female labour force participation rate: India’s gender divide striking (2017)
   Given the scale and complexity of the issue, the government must lead 
from the front to facilitate greater female participation across businesses—
services or manufacturing. But businesses must show the way. While women 
underrepresentation clearly shows the need to extend equal opportunities 
to women, it has a payoff for businesses and the economy at large—higher 
female LFPR would widen the pool of labour, now untapped for centuries! A 
report on State of Working in India 2018 by Azim Premji University shows women 
participation in India rose, albeit marginally, across elementary occupations, 
professional roles and technical employment over 2011–15.

regulAtorY And rePortIng FrAmeWorKs 
Globally, reporting requirements and frameworks – particularly for companies – have 
been evolving. Basic guidelines to limit pollution and appease stakeholder needs were laid 
down in 1990s. The key among them, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 
Standards were formulated way back in 1997. Today, more than 90% of the world’s largest 
250 corporations report sustainability performance. 
The vanguard of corporate India too is actively adopting ESG-based business strategies. 
A case in point is standalone and weighty sustainability reports (up to 100 pages in some 
cases) published by leading corporates. Our interviews of other leading companies also 
corroborate that chairpersons and CEOs are increasingly devoting a disproportionately 
higher amount of time and energy "Seeking Growth – The ESG Way".

Reporting frameworks and requirements have evolved over the past two decades. The 
Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI) – a set of modular 
reporting standards that any organisation can use to report its impact on the economy, the 
environment, and society – is considered among the highest standards globally. 
(A) global standards for sustainability reporting
global standards for sustainability reporting – grI, one of the leading standards
GRI, an independent international organisation, has pioneered corporate sustainability 
reporting since 1997.
The GRI Standards is a set of modular reporting standards that can be used by any 
organisation to report its impact on the economy, the environment, and society. The set 
includes three universal standards applicable to all organisations: GRI 101: Foundation; 
GRI 102: General Disclosures; and GRI 103: Management Approach. In addition, there 
are 33 topic-specific standards, which are classified into Economic, Environmental, and 
Social categories that organisations can select from to report on their material topics.
The GRI Standards are developed through a transparent, multi-stakeholder process 
and are issued by the Global Sustainability Standards Board (GSSB), an independent 
standard-setting body created by the GRI. Thousands of organisations in more than 
90 countries currently use the GRI Standards to report sustainability information. The 
GRI Standards are also referenced in policy or regulation in more than 40 countries and 
regions, and by more than 20 stock exchanges worldwide.
In 2006, the UNO launched the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) based on the 
notion that an ESG approach can affect the performance of investment portfolios and 
should, therefore, be considered alongside more traditional financial factors if investors 
are to properly fulfil their fiduciary duty. The PRI signatories are expected to follow these 
principles, thereby aligning investment activities with interests of the society. We see great 
scope for PRI adoption in furthering the ESG cause.

(B) India’s evolving regulatory and reporting framework
the seBI Brr Framework – the Indian market framework for sustainability 
reporting
In August 2012, securities regulator SEBI issued Business Responsibility Reporting 
(BRR) norms for the top 100 listed entities, thereby stipulating non-financial reporting 
by corporate India. The BRR captures an organisation’s non-financial performance 
across economic, environmental and social factors.
This reporting requirement is in line with the ‘National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, 
Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs)’ notified by the 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India, in 2011. These guidelines contain 
comprehensive principles to be adopted by companies as part of their business 
practices and a structured business responsibility reporting format requiring certain 
specified disclosures, demonstrating the steps taken by companies to implement the 
said principles.
Later, via a circular dated 30 November, 2015, SEBI extended the BRR mandate to the 
top 500 listed entities by market capitalisation, as of March 31st of every year.
(c) India’s evolving governance framework
  India, with its entrenched bureaucracy and multitude of overlapping regulations, has 
come a long way in embedding robust governance practices in corporate culture to 
create positive sentiment in the minds of investors and the public at large. It has been

led by determined efforts by the government, SEBI and stock exchanges. Overall, 
corporate governance norms in India have fairly tightened with focus on corporate 
boards, auditor accountability, and shareholder approval for key transactions and 
enhanced disclosures.

the most recent Indian development
The most recent corporate governance development is the SEBI-driven and Mr Uday Kotak 
(CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank) led SEBI committee on corporate governance in June 2017. It 
was formed in recognition of the need for higher standards, challenges and events in recent 
years, and the scale of India’s markets. This committee report was also to plug gaps in the 
existing framework, and practices that need closer scrutiny. In its findings, the committee 
cited numerous studies to make a somewhat counterintuitive point that the payoff from 
good corporate governance manifests both in operating results of listed companies and their 
market capitalisation.

Other key recommendations of the Committee were introduction of stringent norms 
on board composition, accounts and auditor accountability, related-party transactions 
and disclosures. The recommendations also define minimum director requirements and 
maximum directorships that a director can hold, and stipulates at least one independent 
woman director on the board. Besides, the committee outlined the enhanced role of the 
Audit Committee, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Stakeholder 
Relationship Committee. The committee also recommended greater scrutiny and 
requirement of shareholder approvals for most related-party transactions and stricter 
disclosure norms to improve governance standards.

esg AdoPtIon – PusH And Pull
To its credit, the Government of India has formulated many regulations and offers great 
incentives for promoting environmental, social and governance standards. To be precise, 
on the one hand, there are a myriad of incentives and subsidies in the form of business 
opportunities to embrace environment friendly businesses and practices. On the other 
hand, the government enforced stricter regulations and norms to drive home its intent on 
the matter. The number of such mandatory government regulations and incentives throw 
ample light on the broad scope of ESG in India.
Ranging from the Bharat Stage VI Standards (pollution emissions) to the Namami Gange 
Project, the Government of India has been introducing schemes, regulations and incentives 
to preserve the environment. The two-pronged countervailing approach comprises 
regulatory norms for curbing hazardous business practices with severe penalties for non-
compliance and incentives for promoting environment-friendly businesses.

In contrast to the environmental-related norms and incentives, the social cause has zoomed 
into focus only over the last decade. From mandatory priority sector lending requirements, 
minimum CSR expenditure to a slew of initiatives for financial inclusion, affordable housing 
and medical insurance, to name a few, the government has been very active on the social 
front.  It is mandating, cajoling and incentivising the private sector to play a more proactive 
social enhancement role.

On the governance front, practices and disclosures have improved over time, plugging 
loopholes, grey areas of dispute and potential conflicts of interest. The outcomes of various 
committees, namely the Kumar Mangalam Birla Committee, NR Narayan Murthy Committee 
and the Kotak Committee have been instrumental in tightening regulatory requirements 
towards greater business transparency in general and for the board proceedings in 
particular. That has not stopped meaningful gaps from emerging, but a sustained trend 
towards higher transparency and governance standards is clear.

esg – corPorAte IndIA's eXPerIence
corporate India embedding sdgs in strategic values
India’s securities watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has mandated 
the top 500 listed Indian companies to report non-financial parameters. Such companies 
must, therefore, generate a Business Responsibility Report (BRR) capturing their non-
financial performance across economic, environmental and social factors. Forward-looking 
businesses are proactively adopting ESG-based strategies, evident from the weighty (up to 
100 pages) sustainability reports they publish. 
Our interviews of captains of industry too suggest chairpersons and CEOs are putting 
in disproportionately greater time and effort "Seeking Growth – The ESG Way". We also 
interacted with several ESG thought leaders, consultants, philanthropists and investors, 
and, therefore, recognise first-hand that forward-looking business groups are in fact going 
beyond the mandatory BRR reporting. 
Purpose beyond environment
Our findings on sustainability strategies are also based on three leading Indian 
conglomerates: The Mahindra Group, The Reliance Group and the Aditya Birla Group. Each 
of their sustainability frameworks are interwoven into respective business strategies. Not 
only are these companies making rapid strides in the more traditional environmental 
aspects of ESG, but also diversifying into businesses that seek to fill the much-needed gap 
pertaining to the Social and Governance aspects of ESG.
We showcase three case studies below as a microcosm of what India’s leading home-grown 
conglomerates are doing across some of their business (and have traditional Environment 
sensitive lines of business and exposure). We do believe a rising proportion of businesses 
are training focus on SDGs. While part of this does likely emanate from regulatory pressures 
– either current, or inevitable – we argue much of this push is being driven by evolving 
belief systems among corporate India. We explore their goals, belief systems, and approach 
to sustainability, or their ESG Way of running the business. 
case study I: mahindra group – An early starter
The Mahindra Group has been among the pioneers in corporate India embracing The ESG 
Way to growth.
The group kick-started its Sustainability Reporting Journey in 2007 with an “Alternative 
Thinking” of proactive alignment of business operations to exponentially rising social and 
environmental demands, and new economic opportunities. Incorporating sustainability as 
an important ingredient in its ‘Rise’ philosophy, the Mahindra Group has time and again 
tried to make responsible growth a way of business. Spearheading strong governance 
standards by introducing Sustainability Reports alongside multiple initiatives centred on 
environmental sustainability, the Group’s corporate journey ticks off the much-need social 
checkbox and is impacting the society in a meaningful way.

Mahindra was among the first ones to champion the cause of sustainability by creating 
awareness on the matter – right from boardroom to the shop floor – in order to 
successfully marry its business processes with sustainable practices. It enforced stricter 
monitoring mechanisms on the one hand and set targets for reduction of non-renewable 
energy uses on the other, thereby creating a sustainability blueprint for all companies in 
the Group. The Group also leverages innovation to drive home the sustainability cause. 
For example, to abide by its commitment to slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 
25% over three years through 2019, the Group introduced the novel concept of internal 
carbon price charged per tonne of carbon emitted by unit. 
A notable effort of the Group in preserving the environment is 16.5MW of in-house 
renewable energy capacity. It also achieved Water Positive Status in 2014, having reduced 
water consumption by 1,34,696 m3 over 2016–18. On the social front too, the Mahindra 
Group has made commendable strides with particular focus on improving gender diversity 
in workforce and generous CSR contributions for its girl child programme called Nanhi Kali. 
Other domains that the Group is actively involved in are education, agriculture, farmers 
and youth. 
The Mahindra Group’s integrated approach of developing a sustainable business has been 
ahead of time, in our view, and sets a precedent for corporate India.

It is interesting that strategic decision-making at the Mahindra Group pre-emptively takes 
into consideration stakeholder concerns, thoughts, attitudes and ideas towards social, 
environment and economic issues. The importance of involving shareholders at this stage 
instils a sense of trust and belonging, and finds relevance in the larger scheme of things. 
Periodic evaluations of such material concerns, and marrying them with business processes 
helps in shaping the company’s future course of action inclusively and efficiently.

The company seeks to foster holistic development wherever it operates. Fostering 
rural prosperity is part of its mission and the company, therefore, runs an array of CSR 
programmes. The programmes link material topics to strategic levers to align the core 
business objective of creating shareholder value, employee value, customer value and 
societal value. This helps to identify specific areas of improvement and address each of 
them effectively.

rIl’s materiality assessment process and matrix optimises esg with stakeholder value
RIL has identified material topics through a structured ‘materiality assessment’ exercise. The 
materiality assessment is a mechanism to seek inputs from various stakeholders through 
continued interactions for decision-making. It is a three-step approach involving: 
1)  Identification of material topics based on global material issues and peer group 
benchmarking, which is married to risks and opportunities at the organisational level; 
2)   assessment of material topics; and 3) their prioritisation. RIL thus developed a 
Materiality Matrix report, which marries stakeholder assessment and decision-making 
with economic, environmental and social impact.

case study III:  Aditya Birla group – “think about tomorrow, today!”
The Aditya Birla Group embarked on the path of sustainability relatively late in 2012, but 
with a comprehensive roadmap and a clear intent to shape up sustainable businesses. 
Chairperson Mr K M Birla defined the Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Vision and set up the 
Group Sustainability Cell with the goal of achieving the vision. The Group institutionalised 
a sustainability framework based on three strategic pillars – Responsible Stewardship, 
Stakeholder Engagement and Future Proofing – that each of its businesses must embrace, 
embed and execute.

The Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Vision
The framework evolved into the Aditya Birla Group Sustainability Model, which summarises 
the need for sustaining growth as: “A sustainable business is one that can thrive within 
the needs and constraints of a sustainable world. A business that can reduce its impact 
on externalities...as well as one that can adapt to external factors that are driven by global 
megatrends that will inevitably affect it.” In 2017, the Group mapped the UNO’s SDGs to 
three key levers of its Sustainable Operational Excellence (SOE) strategy, namely People, 
Product and Process.

Future-proofing businesses as ESG narrows operating landscape
responsible stewardship focuses on building a framework of policies and technical and 
management standards that are aligned with international norms defined by organisations 
such as International Finance Corporation, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, and United Nations Global Compact, among others. Integration of these 
standards into the business processes and systems will enable the Group to excel across 
the major triple bottom-line parameters of their operations. 
stakeholder engagement involves building strong relationships with 'strategic 
stakeholders', enabling a broader and more forward-looking perspective on macro 
scenarios such as climate change, human rights and safety. This would help the Group 
anticipate trends that can have potential major impact on its business and take corrective 
or preventive action.
Future Proofing essentially implies weaving sustainability in the blueprint of strategic 
business plans of each unit to minimise risks while looking out for new or innovative 
opportunities; it therefore seeks to prime the pump for the group at large to deal with the 
rapidly changing business environment as far as 2030 or 2050.
